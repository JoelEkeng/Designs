## 1. Introduction

The Smile Page clone project replicates a webpage with a header, a quote section, tutorials on different types of smiles, a membership section, FAQs, and a footer. The project aims to showcase various HTML and CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and responsive webpage.

## 2. Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `Css/styles.css`: The main CSS file responsible for styling the page.
- `Images/`: A folder containing images used in the project.
- `fontawesome-free-6.4.2-web/`: A folder containing the Font Awesome library.

## 3. Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the webpage.

## 4. Custom CSS Variables

In the `styles.css` file, custom CSS variables have been defined at the beginning of the document. 
These variables are used to set background colors and adjust fonts and styles across the entire project. You can modify these variables to customize the visual appearance of the page.

```css
:root {
    --background-color1: #c271ff; /* Background color for the quote section */
    --background-color2: #FFFFFF; /* Background color for text and icons */
    --background-color3: #071629; /* Background color for the membership and footer sections */
}
```

## 5. Media Queries

The project includes media queries to make the webpage responsive on different screen sizes. The media queries are used to adjust font sizes, spacing, and layout as the screen width changes. 
There are media queries for various screen sizes, including mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience.
